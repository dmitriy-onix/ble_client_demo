## **Part 6: Setting Up Secure BLE Server (Pairing & Bonding)**

### **Understanding BLE Security Concepts**

**Pairing** is the process of establishing a secure connection between two BLE devices by exchanging cryptographic keys. **Bonding** stores these keys for future automatic reconnection without re-pairing.

**Just Works Pairing**: The simplest pairing method where devices automatically establish a secure connection without requiring user interaction (no PIN/passkey entry).

### **Step 1: Configure Security Settings in nRF Connect Server**

**Note**: nRF Connect for Mobile has limited security configuration options as a server. Most security enforcement happens at the Android system level.

1. When creating characteristics in **Service 3: Control Service**, ensure you've enabled encryption:  
   * Look for **"Encrypted"** options in permissions  
   * Some versions show **"Authentication required"** checkboxes  
   * If available, enable these for characteristics in the Control Service

### **Step 2: Testing Security from Client Side**

#### **Initial Connection (No Security)**

1. Connect to your BLE server using the client device  
2. Try accessing **Service 1** and **Service 2** characteristics  
3. These should work without any security requirements  
4. Note that these operations complete successfully

#### **Accessing Secured Characteristics**

1. Navigate to **Service 3: Control Service**  
2. Try to read/write to the secured characteristics  
3. You may see different behaviors:  
   * **Android 6.0+**: May automatically trigger pairing dialog  
   * **Older versions**: May show "Insufficient authentication" error

### **Step 3: Initiating Just Works Pairing**

#### **Method 1: Automatic Pairing (Recommended)**

1. In nRF Connect client, attempt to write to a secured characteristic in Service 3  
2. Android should automatically display a pairing dialog  
3. Both devices will show **"Bluetooth pairing request"**  
4. Tap **"PAIR"** on both devices  
5. No PIN/passkey entry required (Just Works)  
6. Connection should now be secured

#### **Method 2: Manual Bonding Initiation**

1. In nRF Connect client, tap the **"Options"** menu (three dots) while connected  
2. Look for **"Bond"** or **"Pair"** option  
3. Select it to initiate pairing process  
4. Follow the same pairing dialog process

### **Step 4: Testing Bonded Connection Behavior**

#### **Immediate Testing (Same Session)**

1. After pairing, retry accessing Service 3 characteristics  
2. Operations should now succeed without additional prompts  
3. Write different values to LED Control and Command characteristics  
4. Verify that previously blocked operations now work

#### **Testing Persistent Bonding**

1. **Disconnect** the BLE connection (don't unpair)  
2. **Reconnect** to the same server device  
3. Try accessing Service 3 characteristics immediately  
4. If bonding worked: Operations should succeed without re-pairing  
5. If bonding failed: You'll need to pair again

### **Step 5: Managing Bonding States**

#### **Viewing Bonded Devices**

1. In Android **Settings** ‚Üí **Bluetooth**  
2. Find your server device in the paired devices list  
3. It should show as "Paired" with your server device name

#### **Testing Both Bonded and Non-Bonded Scenarios**

**Scenario A: Bonded Connection**

1. Keep devices paired in Android settings  
2. Connect via nRF Connect  
3. Access Service 3 characteristics directly

**Scenario B: Non-Bonded Connection**

1. **Unpair** devices in Android Bluetooth settings  
2. Connect via nRF Connect (new pairing required)  
3. Try accessing Service 3 ‚Üí should trigger new pairing dialog

#### **Clearing Bond Information**

1. In Android **Settings** ‚Üí **Bluetooth**  
2. Find the paired device  
3. Tap the **gear/settings icon** next to device name  
4. Select **"Unpair"** or **"Forget"**  
5. This clears all bonding information

### **Step 6: Understanding Security Behaviors**

#### **Expected Security Flow**

1. **First Connection**: No security, can access Services 1 & 2  
2. **Access Service 3**: Triggers pairing dialog (Just Works)  
3. **After Pairing**: Full access to all characteristics  
4. **Reconnection**: Automatic security (if bonded) or re-pair if bond cleared

#### **Authentication vs. Encryption**

* **Authentication**: Verifies the identity of the connected device (requires pairing)  
* **Encryption**: Protects data in transit (automatic after pairing)  
* **Service 3 characteristics**: Require both for read/write operations

### **Step 7: Advanced Security Testing**

#### **Testing Different Error Conditions**

1. **Before Pairing**: Try writing to secured characteristics

   * Expected result: "Insufficient authentication" or automatic pairing prompt  
2. **Connection without Bonding**: Clear bonds, connect, don't pair

   * Expected result: Can read Services 1&2, blocked from Service 3  
3. **Partial Operations**: After pairing, test each secured characteristic

   * All Service 3 operations should work normally

#### **Monitoring Security Events**

1. In nRF Connect, watch for security-related log messages  
2. Look for indicators like:  
   * "Security request sent"  
   * "Pairing completed"  
   * "Bond saved"  
   * "Encryption enabled"

### **Step 8: Educational Security Concepts**

#### **Key Learning Points**

* **Service Separation**: Unsecured services (1&2) vs. secured service (3) demonstrate security boundaries  
* **Just Works Simplicity**: No user interaction required, suitable for IoT devices  
* **Bonding Benefits**: Eliminates repeated pairing for trusted devices  
* **Android Integration**: BLE security integrates with Android's Bluetooth management

#### **Real-World Applications**

* **Fitness Trackers**: Basic data (steps, heart rate) unsecured; personal settings secured  
* **Smart Locks**: Status information public; control commands require authentication  
* **Medical Devices**: General health data readable; configuration requires pairing

#### **Security Limitations in nRF Connect**

* **Server-side limitations**: nRF Connect for Mobile cannot enforce all security policies as a server  
* **Testing focus**: Better for understanding client-side security behavior  
* **Production deployment**: Real devices would have more granular security control

### **Troubleshooting Security Issues**

1. **Pairing Dialog Doesn't Appear**:

   * Ensure characteristics have proper encryption settings  
   * Try clearing Bluetooth cache: Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Bluetooth ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Clear Cache  
   * Restart both devices  
2. **Bond Not Persistent**:

   * Check if devices remain in Android paired device list  
   * Some Android versions may not maintain bonds with non-standard devices  
   * Try the bonding process again  
3. **Still Getting Authentication Errors After Pairing**:

   * Verify the pairing completed successfully on both devices  
   * Check that encrypted permissions are properly set on characteristics  
   * Try disconnecting and reconnecting  
4. **Cannot Access Any Characteristics**:

   * Ensure Services 1 & 2 don't have encryption enabled (for comparison)  
   * Only Service 3 should require authentication  
   * Verify server is still running after pairing process

## **Part 7: Data Format Guidelines**

### **Working with Hex Values:**

* **Single byte values**: `00` to `FF` (0-255 in decimal)  
* **Multi-byte values**: `1628` (2 bytes), `A1B2C3` (3 bytes)  
* **Common conversions**:  
  * Percentage: 85% \= `55` in hex  
  * Temperature: 22.4¬∞C \= `1628` (custom encoding)  
  * Boolean: OFF \= `00`, ON \= `01`

### **Working with Text Values:**

* Use for human-readable data: status messages, commands, device names  
* Examples: "ready", "error", "start", "v1.0.0"  
* No length restrictions in nRF Connect

## **Troubleshooting Tips**

1. **Connection Issues**:  
   * Ensure both devices have Bluetooth enabled  
   * Try restarting the advertiser if connection fails  
   * Check that the server is running  
2. **Characteristic Issues**:  
   * Verify UUIDs are unique within each service  
   * Ensure properties match permissions  
   * For hex values, use valid hex characters (0-9, A-F)  
3. **Notification Problems**:  
   * Client must subscribe before notifications work  
   * Server must have notification property enabled  
   * Update values on server to trigger notifications  
4. **Value Format Issues**:  
   * Use only Text or Bytes (Hex) \- no other data types available  
   * For numeric data, encode as hex bytes and document the conversion  
   * Test hex values are properly formatted before sending  
5. **Security Issues**:  
   * Clear Bluetooth cache if pairing dialogs don't appear  
   * Verify both devices completed the pairing process  
   * Check Android Bluetooth settings for paired device status  
   * Remember that only Service 3 characteristics should require authentication
